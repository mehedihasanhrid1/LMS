    <h4>Pizza is a popular Italian dish that consists of a round, flat base of dough topped with various ingredients. Traditionally, the dough is made from flour, water, yeast, and salt, and is baked at high temperatures, often in a wood-fired oven. <br><br>
    The most classic pizza is the Margherita, featuring a simple topping of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and basil. However, pizzas can be customized with a wide variety of toppings, including pepperoni, vegetables, seafood, and different cheeses, allowing for endless combinations. <br><br>
    Pizza is typically served in slices and is loved for its savory flavor, crispy crust, and gooey cheese. It can be enjoyed at restaurants, pizzerias, or made at home, and is often accompanied by sides like garlic bread or salads. Its versatility and universal appeal make it a favorite food worldwide.</h4>
